I'm Naiyarah, a Machine Learning Engineer from the UAE working to make AI safer and more reliable. I'm co-building AI Safety UAE, leading West & Central Asia work at AI Safety Asia, and learning a ton about AI policy & international relations along the way. My background is in Technical AI Safety & Advocacy, low-resource language datasets, and hallucination-resistant models. These days, I'm focused on AI governance frameworks, AI diplomacy, and connecting local talent to global opportunities in AI safety.
